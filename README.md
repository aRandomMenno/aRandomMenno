## I am... JustMenno :)

My name is Menno and I live at 127.0.0.1 on my computer. I love to spend more time on a problem than needed, so that I do not have enough time for other things.

## What I do

I am currently still studying, I'm following a Software Development course in the Netherlands. Which is going great I've learned things... for one that I *really* dislike php and phpstorm.

Other things I do include but are not limited to: trying to learn C# so I can make a Terarria mod and trying to get into cyber security and ethical hacking and that stuff.

I also like to make pictures with a pohoto camera I am lending one from someone I know, although I am not the best I would say I'm good enough for now. I'd like to spend more time making photographs, but for some reason I'm stopping myself.

Also I'm absolutely not a social person, I do like to speak to people but I have trouble to make first contact and keeping the contact up.
