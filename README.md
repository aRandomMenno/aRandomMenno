## Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Menno

I like programming and hacking, however I'm pretty bad at both to be honest. this is simply because I spend more time gaming than learning to program or hack, which is sad. Because I really like doing stuff that makes me a better person and could help me make a difference.
Currently I'm busy with school, I will be styding at [Grafisch Lycuem Rotterdam](https://www.glr.nl/) for the next 3 years, I will be starting in August of 2024.
I love programming, currently it's my hobby but I want to make it my work. Thats why I will be going to Grafisch Lycuem Rotterdam to study [Software Developer](https://www.glr.nl/opleidingen/software-developer).

If you would like to contact me you could do that with Signal, `RainBreak.3143` or on discord with `stackedunderflow` but I would prefer Signal. :)
