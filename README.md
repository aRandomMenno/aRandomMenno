## Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Menno

I have a passion for programming and hacking, although I must admit I'm still learning and improving. I often find myself gaming more than coding, which is something I'm working on changing. I truly enjoy activities that contribute to my personal growth and can potentially make a difference.

Currently, I'm focused on my studies (and pretty busy with it). I'm studying at het [Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam](https://www.glr.nl/) since August 2024, where I am following a course in [Software Development](https://www.glr.nl/opleidingen/software-developer) for the next three years. My goal is to turn my love for programming from a hobby into a career.

Feel free to reach out to me on Signal at `aRandomMenno.3143` or on Discord at `stackedunderflow`. I prefer using Signal. In the future, I might create a Signal group if there's enough interest.
