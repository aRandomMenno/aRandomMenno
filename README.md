## I am JustMenno :)

My name is Menno and I live at 0.0.0.0:18 on my computer. I love to spend _way_ more time on problems than needed, which conveniently ensures I don’t have enough time for other things.
You're not allowed to call me "Men" or any other short names. Seriously. Don't.

## What do I do

I am still studying, I'm following a Software Development course in the Netherlands. Which is going great I've learned... things. 
When we started working with PHP at the end of the first year I didn't like the language, but now 5 months or so later I think I _kinda_ like the language.
Other things I do outside of school include but are not limited to: programming for fun, taking pictures, sleeping, and gaming.

## (Fun?) facts

1. I'm absolutely not a social person, I do like to speak to people but I have trouble to make first contact and keeping the contact up.
2. I value privacy, which big companies are actively trying to take away (I should be GitLab instead I know).
3. I tend to ignore everything around me when I don't want to do something.
